CookieClickerChromeSyncer
=========================

This extension serves two main purposes:

1. It backs up your game to Chrome's builtin storage (chrome.storage API). This allows you to load your Cookie Clicker save from any Chrome browser that you are logged into*. If you are logged into multiple browsers at the same time and running multiple instances of the game, the game with the highest HC/total cookie count will be used.

2. It allows you to send a saved game to your home (or other) computer automatically. You set (one or more) browsers to "primary" and when you decide, you can tell all "primary" browsers to load your current game. This allows you to login from a friends house (or work/school), make changes to your game, then send them back to your home computer so you can continue earning cookies.

Author note: This extension was built to meet my personal needs. While I am open to feature requests, I do not intend on growing this project into anything larger than it should be. Please report any defects or bugs, I am certainly interested in fixing those ASAP.
